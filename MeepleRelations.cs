public class MeepleRelations : MonoBehaviour
{
	//While the Social need may still be tracked from the MeepleNeeds script, the MeepleRelation script will contain detailed information on all of a Meeple's relationships.
	//This includes, but is not limited to, all of the other Meeples this Meeple currently has a relationship with, as well as the value of those relationships.
	//Methods here will involve adding (or removing) Meeples from the Relationship list, as well as changing the values of each relationship.
	//Each individual relationship will likely be stored as a List or Array.
	//Elements in the List / Array will contain things like the name of the other Meeple, the integer value of their Relationship, etc.

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start ()

	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update ()
