public class MeepleActions : MonoBehaviour
{
	//This script will contain all of the methods for all Actions that Meeples may perform at any given Station.
	//For example, each different type of Food that a Meeple might Eat will have its own method here. These methods will then call the appropriate methods from
	//the MeepleNeeds script, and pass the appropriate values on.
	//In the future, we could have a seperate script which simply lists all types of Food, and have a single Eat method here, with different values determined by
	//the Food found in the other library script.

	// Use this for initialization

	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update ()
